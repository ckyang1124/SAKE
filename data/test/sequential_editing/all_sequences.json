To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?\n\nOptions:\nLimestone is never pure CaCO3.\nLimestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\nCarbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\nPerhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.",
